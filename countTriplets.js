/**
You are given an array and you need to find number of tripets of indices (i, j, k) such that the elements at those indices are in geometric progression for a given common ratio r and i < j < k.]

For example, arr = [1,4,16,64]. If r=4, we have [1,4,16] and [4,16,64] at indices (0,1,2) and (1,2,3).
