/*
	Implement an Iterator of Iterators which traverses through  an arbitrary number of iterators. IE, an iterator which iterates over three list iterators in the following way:
	
	L1 = a1, a2, a3
	L2 = b1, b2, b3
	L3 = c1, c2, c3

	Then the iterator should process them in this order:
	a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2, a3, b3, c3
